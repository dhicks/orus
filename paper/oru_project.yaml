    Statistical inference often fails to replicate. One reason is that many
    results may be selected for drawing inference because some threshold of a
    statistic like the P-value was crossed, leading to biased reported effect
    sizes. Nonetheless, considerable non-replication is to be expected even
    without selective reporting, and generalizations from single studies are
    rarely if ever warranted. Honestly reported results must vary from
    replication to replication because of varying assumption violations and
    random variation; excessive agreement itself would suggest deeper problems,
    such as failure to publish results in conflict with group expectations or
    desires. A general perception of a “replication crisis” may thus reflect
    failure to recognize that statistical tests not only test hypotheses, but
    countless assumptions and the entire environment in which research takes
    place. Because of all the uncertain and unknown assumptions that underpin
    statistical inferences, we should treat inferential statistics as highly
    unstable local descriptions of relations between assumptions and data,
    rather than as providing generalizable inferences about hypotheses or
    models. And that means we should treat statistical results as being much
    more incomplete and uncertain than is currently the norm. Acknowledging this
    uncertainty could help reduce the allure of selective reporting: Since a
    small P-value could be large in a replication study, and a large P-value
    could be small, there is simply no need to selectively report studies based
    on statistical results. Rather than focusing our study reports on uncertain
    conclusions, we should thus focus on describing accurately how the study was
    conducted, what problems occurred, what data were obtained, what analysis
    methods were used and why, and what output those methods produced.

  abstract: >-
    In his analysis of “the essential tension between tradition and innovation”
    Thomas S. Kuhn focused on the apparent paradox that, on the one hand, normal
    research is a highly convergent activity based upon a settled consensus,
    but, on the other hand, the ultimate effect of this tradition-bound work has
    invariably been to change the tradition. Kuhn argued that, on the one hand,
    without the possibility of divergent thought, fundamental innovation would
    be precluded. On the other hand, without a strong emphasis on convergent
    thought, science would become a mess created by continuous theory changes
    and scientific progress would again be precluded. On Kuhn’s view, both
    convergent and divergent thought are therefore equally necessary for the
    progress of science. In this paper, I shall argue that a similar fundamental
    tension exists between the demands we see for novel insights of an
    interdisciplinary nature and the need for established intellectual doctrines
    founded in the classical disciplines. First, I shall revisit Kuhn’s analysis
    of the essential tension between tradition and innovation. Next, I shall
    argue that the tension inherent in interdisciplinary research between, on
    the one hand, intellectual independence and critical scrutiny and, on the
    other hand, epistemic dependence and trust is a complement to Kuhn’s
    essential tension within mono-disciplinary science between convergent and
    divergent thought.

    “The important thing is not to win, it is to take part,” this famous saying
    by Pierre de Coubertin asserts that the value athletes draw from Olympic
    games lies in their participation in the event and not in the gold they
    collect during it. We find similar evidence for scientists involved in grant
    competitions. Relying on unique data from a Swiss funding program, we find
    that scientists taking part in a research grant competition boost their
    number of publications and average impact factor while extending their
    knowledge base and their collaboration network regardless of the result of
    the competition. Receiving the funds increases the probability of
    co-authoring with co-applicants but has no additional impact on the
    individual productivity.

  abstract: >-
    The article examines whether scientific production, research funding, Impact
    Factor of journals and size of collaborative teams have an influence on the
    propensity to receive more citations, and whether the influence of these
    factors differs across genders. Using a very complete database of funding,
    scientific papers and citations compiled at the individual researchers’
    level, we estimate panel data regressions on the discipline-normalised
    citation rates of individual academics in Quebec. Our results show that
    although most of the indicators examined have a positive influence on the
    relative citation rate, when it comes to gender differences, not having
    enough public funding and raising private funding appear slightly
    detrimental for women in the health sciences. In addition, when women
    collaborate with the same number of co-authors as men, or target similar
    Impact Factor journals, their articles are less cited then those of their
    male colleagues. Almost no gender effect is found in the natural sciences
    and engineering where women are still a minority. Our results worryingly
    show that academics who publish with a larger proportion of female
    co-authors are less cited. Furthermore, when targeting similar Impact Factor
    journals, researchers who collaborate with a higher proportion of female
    co-authors are consistently less cited in both the health and NSE fields
    than if they were publishing with a male dominated group of co-authors.

  abstract: >-
    Many universities have developed large-scale interdisciplinary research
    centers to address societal challenges and to attract the attention of
    private philanthropists and federal agencies. However, prior studies have
    mostly shown that interdisciplinary centers relate to a narrow band of
    outcomes such as publishing and grants. Therefore, we shift attention to
    include outcomes that have been the centers mandate to influence − namely
    outreach to the media and private industry, as well as broader research
    endeavors and securing external funding. Using data covering Stanford
    University between 1993 and 2014, we study if being weakly and strongly
    affiliated with interdisciplinary centers in one year relates to and
    increases (1) knowledge production (publications, grants and inventions),
    (2) instruction (numbers of students taught, PhDs and postdocs advised), (3)
    intellectual prominence (media mentions, awards won and centrality within
    the larger collaboration network), and (4) the acquisition of various
    sources of funding in the next year. Our results indicate that
    interdisciplinary centers select productive faculty and increase their
    activity on a broad range of outcomes further, and in ways greater than
    departments and traditional interdisciplinary memberships, such as courtesy
    and joint appointments.

    SummaryThis paper presents a new map representing the structure of all of
    science, based on journal articles, including both the natural and social
    sciences. Similar to cartographic maps of our world, the map of science
    provides a bird’s eye view of today’s scientific landscape. It can be used
    to visually identify major areas of science, their size, similarity, and
    interconnectedness. In order to be useful, the map needs to be accurate on a
    local and on a global scale. While our recent work has focused on the former
    aspect,1 this paper summarizes results on how to achieve structural
    accuracy. Eight alternative measures of journal similarity were applied to a
    data set of 7,121 journals covering over 1 million documents in the combined
    Science Citation and Social Science Citation Indexes. For each journal
    similarity measure we generated two-dimensional spatial layouts using the
    force-directed graph layout tool, VxOrd. Next, mutual information values
    were calculated for each graph at different clustering levels to give a
    measure of structural accuracy for each map. The best co-citation and
    inter-citation maps according to local and structural accuracy were selected
    and are presented and characterized. These two maps are compared to
    establish robustness. The inter-citation map is then used to examine
    linkages between disciplines. Biochemistry appears as the most
    interdisciplinary discipline in science.

  abstract: >-
    The NSF engineering research centers (ERC) program served notice of a sea
    change in university research funding and institutional designs,
    representing a transition from department-based, principle
    investigator-oriented university science to a new center-based model
    encouraging universities to work with industry and to work beyond the
    strictures of academic disciplines. In our view, the past three decades of
    U.S. science and technology policy have not seen an institutional change of
    greater importance. This paper begins with a brief history of the ERC
    program, including discussion of the program’s origins, goals and research
    foci, growth, and influence as a model for other science center programs in
    the U.S. and abroad. Our “primary data” include an interview with Erich
    Bloch, former NSF director who was one of the chief architects and advocates
    for the ERC program. Because of the historical importance of this interview,
    we present the entire interview with the original material largely
    unaltered. We conclude with discussion of the managerial challenges that
    ERCs face within the context of traditional university structures.

  abstract: >-
    Complex environmental problems require well-researched policies that
    integrate knowledge from both the natural and social sciences. Epistemic
    differences can impede interdisciplinary collaboration, as shown by debates
    between conservation biologists and anthropologists who are working to
    preserve biological diversity and support economic development in central
    Africa. Disciplinary differences with regard to 1) facts, 2) rigor, 3)
    causal explanation, and 4) research goals reinforce each other, such that
    early decisions about how to define concepts or which methods to adopt may
    tilt research design and data interpretation toward one discipline's
    epistemological framework. If one of the contributing fields imposes a
    solution to an epistemic problem, this sets the stage for what I call
    disciplinary capture. Avoiding disciplinary capture requires clear
    communication between collaborators, but beyond this it also requires that
    collaborators craft research questions and innovate research designs which
    are different from the inherited epistemological frameworks of contributing
    disciplines.

  abstract: >-
    Interdisciplinary research is widely considered a hothouse for innovation,
    and the only plausible approach to complex problems such as climate change.
    One barrier to interdisciplinary research is the widespread perception that
    interdisciplinary projects are less likely to be funded than those with a
    narrower focus. However, this commonly held belief has been difficult to
    evaluate objectively, partly because of lack of a comparable, quantitative
    measure of degree of interdisciplinarity that can be applied to funding
    application data. Here we compare the degree to which research proposals
    span disparate fields by using a biodiversity metric that captures the
    relative representation of different fields (balance) and their degree of
    difference (disparity). The Australian Research Council’s Discovery
    Programme provides an ideal test case, because a single annual nationwide
    competitive grants scheme covers fundamental research in all disciplines,
    including arts, humanities and sciences. Using data on all 18,476 proposals
    submitted to the scheme over 5 consecutive years, including successful and
    unsuccessful applications, we show that the greater the degree of
    interdisciplinarity, the lower the probability of being funded. The negative
    impact of interdisciplinarity is significant even when number of
    collaborators, primary research field and type of institution are taken into
    account. This is the first broad-scale quantitative assessment of success
    rates of interdisciplinary research proposals. The interdisciplinary
    distance metric allows efficient evaluation of trends in research funding,
    and could be used to identify proposals that require assessment strategies
    appropriate to interdisciplinary research.

    In 2004, the International Evaluation Panel of the Academy of Finland
    indicated that the Academy should develop its research policies, evaluation
    systems, and organization to encourage more interdisciplinary research. One
    consequence of the Panel’s recommendations was that the Academy commissioned
    this study from a research group comprised of the authors of this report.
    The objectives of the study were (1) to investigate to what extent and how
    the Academy had promoted interdisciplinary research in its annual General
    Research Grants in 1997, 2000, and 2004, and (2) to recommend how the
    Academy could improve its capabilities in fostering interdisciplinary
    research. The study is based on a qualitative analysis of research proposals
    from the three years, a survey of researchers, interviews with the Academy’s
    presenting officials, a literature survey linking the empirical analysis to
    theoretical discussion concerning the concept of interdisciplinary research,
    its role in the production of new knowledge, related issues of assessment
    and institutional capacity, and science policy instruments on the basis of
    international and national experiences.

    The attrition of women from science with increasing career stage continues,
    suggesting that current strategies are unsuccessful. Research evaluation
    using unbiased metrics could be important for the retention of women,
    because other factors such as implicit bias are unlikely to quickly change.
    We compare the publishing patterns of men and women within the discipline of
    ecology and show sexual dimorphism in self-citation leading to higher
    h-index scores for men despite lower citations per paper, which is
    exacerbated by more career absences by women. However, if self-citations and
    non-research active years are excluded, there are no gender differences in
    research performance. The pattern is consistent across disciplines and may
    contribute to current geographic disparities in research performance,
    rewarding confident behavior and traditional career paths rather than
    research impact. Importantly, these changes would not disadvantage anyone,
    because self-citation does not indicate broader impact, and researchers
    should only be judged on their research-active career.

    Objectives: Gender inequity in academic medicine persists despite increases
    in the number of women physicians. We sought to explore gender differences
    in research productivity for academic psychiatrists in Canada.

    Methods: In a cross-sectional study of the 3379 psychiatrists in all 17
    university departments of psychiatry in Canada, research productivity, as
    measured by the h-index and number of publications, was compared between
    women and men using a negative log binomial regression model to generate
    relative rates (RRs), adjusted for career duration (aRR). Findings were
    stratified by academic rank, institution region, and institution size. A
    subanalysis of those with 10 or more publications was conducted as a proxy
    for identifying physicians on a research track.

    Results: Women (43% of the sample) had a lower mean (standard deviation)
    h-index than men (2.87 [6.49] vs. 5.31 [11.1]; aRR, 0.62; 95% confidence
    interval [CI], 0.54 to 0.72). Differences were significant only for junior
    faculty and not for associate and full professors. Comparison by number of
    publications followed a similar pattern (aRR, 0.46; 95% CI, 0.39 to 0.55).
    Among those with 10 or more publications (n ¼ 721), differences between men
    and women were smaller than in the overall cohort for both the h-index (aRR,
    0.77; 95% CI, 0.68 to 0.87) and number of publications (aRR, 0.62; 95% CI,
    0.53 to 0.72).

    Conclusions: Gender differences in research productivity at the national
    level in academic psychiatry in Canada support a call to adopt a more
    systematic approach to promoting equitable opportunities for women in
    research, especially in early career, to improve diversity and enhance
    future psychiatric research and discovery.

  abstract: >-
    The phrase ‘trading zone’ is often used to denote any kind of
    interdisciplinary partnership in which two or more perspectives are combined
    and a new, shared language develops. In this paper we distinguish between
    different types of trading zone by asking whether the collaboration is
    co-operative or coerced and whether the end-state is a heterogeneous or
    homogeneous culture. In so doing, we find that the voluntary development of
    a new language community—what we call an inter-language trading
    zone—represents only one of four possible configurations. In developing this
    argument we show how different modes of collaboration result in different
    kinds of trading zone, how different kinds of trading zone may be ‘nested’
    inside each other and discuss how a single collaboration might move between
    different kinds of trading zone over time. One implication of our analysis
    is that interactional expertise is a central component of at least one class
    of trading zone.

  abstract: >-
    Although originally developed by R.K. Merton to explain advancement in
    scientific careers, cumulative advantage is a general mechanism for
    inequality across any temporal process (e.g., life course, family
    generations) in which a favorable relative position becomes a resource that
    produces further relative gains. This review shows that the term cumulative
    advantage has developed multiple meanings in the sociological literature. We
    distinguish between these alternative forms, discuss mechanisms that have
    been proposed in the literature that may produce cumulative advantage, and
    review the empirical literature in the areas of education, careers, and
    related life course processes.

  abstract: >-
    Ludwik Fleck’s theory of thought-styles has been hailed as a pioneer of
    constructivist science studies and sociology of scientific knowledge. But
    this consensus ignores an important feature of Fleck’s epistemology. At the
    core of his account is the ideal of ‘objective truth, clarity, and
    accuracy’. I begin with Fleck’s account of modern natural science, locating
    the ideal of scientific objectivity within his general social epistemology.
    I then draw on Fleck’s view of scientific objectivity to improve upon
    reflexive accounts of the origin and development of the theory of
    thought-styles, and reply to objections that Fleck’s epistemological stance
    is self-undermining or inconsistent. Explicating the role of scientific
    objectivity in Fleck’s epistemology reveals his view to be an internally
    consistent alternative to recent social accounts of scientific objectivity
    by Harding, Daston and Galison. I use these contrasts to indicate the
    strengths and weaknesses of Fleck’s innovative social epistemology, and
    propose modifications to address the latter. The result is a renewed version
    of Fleck’s social epistemology, which reconciles commitment to scientific
    objectivity with integrated sociology, history and philosophy of science.

    Teaser“One reason to be optimistic about systems biology’s prospects for
    striking an effective balance among multiple methods is that the field is
    highly pluralistic and diverse. The label ‘systems biology’ covers a wide
    range of projects with diverse influences, ranging from efforts to discover
    physical laws in biology to using mathematical models to suggest experiments
    to identify components of molecular mechanisms. Such pluralism is
    well-motivated, especially in these early days of systems biology. A variety
    of different ways of integrating experimentation and mathematical modeling,
    and diverse associated concepts, should be tried out to see what works.
    Philosophers can play a role here, in characterizing and assessing these
    different strategies.”

    Expanding on recent philosophical contributions to the conceptual and
    normative framework of scientific imperialism, I examine whether the
    economics approach to social epistemology can be considered a case of
    economics imperialism and determine whether economics’ explanatory
    expansionism appropriately contributes to this philosophical subfield or
    not. I argue first that the economics approach to social epistemology counts
    as a case of economics imperialism under a broad conception of the term, and
    second that we have good reasons to doubt the appropriateness of the
    incursion of economics into social epistemology, insofar as economics’
    attempt at explanatory unification fails to express significant human
    interests.

    "I want to get at the blown glass of the early cloud chambers and the oozing
    noodles of wet nuclear emulsion; to the resounding crack of a high-voltage
    spark arcing across a high-tension chamber and leaving the lab stinking of
    ozone; to the silent, darkened room, with row after row of scanners sliding
    trackballs across projected bubble-chamber images. Pictures and pulses—I
    want to know where they came from, how pictures and counts got to be the
    bottom-line data of physics." (from the preface)  Image and Logic is the
    most detailed engagement to date with the impact of modern technology on
    what it means to "do" physics and to be a physicist. At the beginning of
    this century, physics was usually done by a lone researcher who put together
    experimental apparatus on a benchtop. Now experiments frequently are larger
    than a city block, and experimental physicists live very different lives:
    programming computers, working with industry, coordinating vast teams of
    scientists and engineers, and playing politics.  Peter L. Galison probes the
    material culture of experimental microphysics to reveal how the
    ever-increasing scale and complexity of apparatus have distanced physicists
    from the very science that drew them into experimenting, and have fragmented
    microphysics into different technical traditions much as apparatus have
    fragmented atoms to get at the fundamental building blocks of matter. At the
    same time, the necessity for teamwork in operating multimillion-dollar
    machines has created dynamic "trading zones," where instrument makers,
    theorists, and experimentalists meet, share knowledge, and coordinate the
    extraordinarily diverse pieces of the culture of modern microphysics: work,
    machines, evidence, and argument.

    While traditional grants remain central in US federal support of academic
    scientists and engineers, the role of multidisciplinary NSF Centers is
    growing. Little is known about how funding through these Centers affects
    scientific output or (as is an NSF aim) increases academic collaboration
    with industry. This paper tests the use of CVs to examine how Center funding
    affects researchers' publication rates and their obtaining industry
    grants.We find that CVs are indeed usable, but some ways of collecting them
    work much better than others, and that researchers who obtain Center grants
    are more likely to obtain grants from industry too, suggesting that this NSF
    aim is being met. We do not find that Centers improve publication rates.

    There has been considerable effort in the last decade to increase the
    participation of women in engineering through various policies. However,
    there has been little empirical research on gender disparities in
    engineering which help underpin the effective preparation, co-ordination,
    and implementation of the science and technology (S&T) policies. This
    article aims to present a comprehensive gendered analysis of engineering
    publications across different specialties and provide a cross-gender
    analysis of research output and scientific impact of engineering researchers
    in academic, governmental, and industrial sectors. For this purpose, 679,338
    engineering articles published from 2008 to 2013 are extracted from the Web
    of Science database and 974,837 authorships are analyzed. The structures of
    co-authorship collaboration networks in different engineering disciplines
    are examined, highlighting the role of female scientists in the diffusion of
    knowledge. The findings reveal that men dominate 80% of all the scientific
    production in engineering. Women engineers publish their papers in journals
    with higher Impact Factors than their male peers, but their work receives
    lower recognition (fewer citations) from the scientific community.
    Engineers—regardless of their gender—contribute to the reproduction of the
    male-dominated scientific structures through forming and repeating their
    collaborations predominantly with men. The results of this study call for
    integration of data driven gender-related policies in existing S&T
    discourse.

    Many degree programs in science and engineering aim at enabling their
    students to perform interdisciplinary problem solving. In this paper we
    present three types of expertise that are involved in different ways in
    interdisciplinary problem solving. In doing so we shall first characterise
    two important epistemological challenges commonly faced in interdisciplinary
    problem solving, namely the communication challenge that arises from the use
    of different concepts within different scientific domains, and the
    integration challenge that arises from the differences between
    domain-specific epistemological standards. Next, drawing on recent work on
    expertise developed within science studies, we characterize the
    interactional expertise that is a precondition for scientists to communicate
    across scientific domains, and the integrational expertise that is a
    precondition for scientists to be able to integrate cognitive resources
    originating in different domains. Finally, we shall analyse how different
    types of interdisciplinary problem solving sets different requirements for
    interactional and integrational expertise and discuss the implications for
    science and engineering programs in higher education.

    Evolutionary systems biology (ESB) aims to integrate methods from systems
    biology and evolutionary biology to go beyond the current limitations in
    both fields. This article clarifies some conceptual difficulties of this
    integration project, and shows how they can be overcome. The main challenge
    we consider involves the integration of evolutionary biology with
    developmental dynamics, illustrated with two examples. First, we examine
    historical tensions between efforts to define general evolutionary
    principles and articulation of detailed mechanistic explanations of specific
    traits. Next, these tensions are further clarified by considering a recent
    case from another field focused on developmental dynamics: stem cell
    biology. In the stem cell case, incompatible explanatory aims block
    integration. Experimental approaches aim at mechanistic explanation while
    dynamical system models offer explanation in terms of general principles. We
    then discuss an ESB case in which integration succeeds: search for general
    attractors using a dynamical systems framework synergizes with the
    experimental search for detailed mechanisms. Contrasts between the positive
    and negative cases suggest general lessons for achieving an integrated
    understanding of developmental and evolutionary dynamics. The key
    integrative move is to acknowledge two complementary aims, both relevant to
    explanation: identifying the space of possible dynamic states and
    trajectories, and mechanistic understanding of causal interactions
    underlying a specific phenomenon of interest. These two aims can support one
    another in a joint project characterizing dynamic aspects of evolving
    lineages. This more inclusive project can lead to insights that cannot be
    reached by either approach in isolation.

    Background

    Large cross-disciplinary scientific teams are becoming increasingly
    prominent in the conduct of research.

    Purpose

    This paper reports on a quasi-experimental longitudinal study conducted to
    compare bibliometric indicators of scientific collaboration, productivity,
    and impact of center-based transdisciplinary team science initiatives and
    traditional investigator-initiated grants in the same field.

    Methods

    All grants began between 1994 and 2004 and up to 10 years of publication
    data were collected for each grant. Publication information was compiled and
    analyzed during the spring and summer of 2010.

    Results

    Following an initial lag period, the transdisciplinary research center
    grants had higher overall publication rates than the investigator-initiated
    R01 (NIH Research Project Grant Program) grants. There were relatively
    uniform publication rates across the research center grants compared to
    dramatically dispersed publication rates among the R01 grants. On average,
    publications produced by the research center grants had greater numbers of
    coauthors but similar journal impact factors compared with publications
    produced by the R01 grants.

    Conclusions

    The lag in productivity among the transdisciplinary center grants was offset
    by their overall higher publication rates and average number of coauthors
    per publication, relative to investigator-initiated grants, over the 10-year
    comparison period. The findings suggest that transdisciplinary center grants
    create benefits for both scientific productivity and collaboration.

    This study investigated the evolution of library and information science
    (LIS) by analyzing research topics in LIS journal articles. The analysis is
    divided into five periods covering the years 1996–2019. Latent Dirichlet
    allocation modeling was used to identify underlying topics based on 14,035
    documents. An improved data-selection method was devised in order to
    generate a dynamic journal list that included influential journals for each
    period. Results indicate that (a) library science has become less prevalent
    over time, as there are no top topic clusters relevant to library issues
    since the period 2000–2005; (b) bibliometrics, especially citation analysis,
    is highly stable across periods, as reflected by the stable subclusters and
    consistent keywords; and (c) information retrieval has consistently been the
    dominant domain with interests gradually shifting to model-based text
    processing. Information seeking and behavior is also a stable field that
    tends to be dispersed among various topics rather than presented as its own
    subject. Information systems and organizational activities have been
    continuously discussed and have developed a closer relationship with
    e-commerce. Topics that occurred only once have undergone a change of
    technological context from the networks and Internet to social media and
    mobile applications.

    One important reason for the use of field categorization in bibliometrics is
    the necessity to make citation impact of papers published in different
    scientific fields comparable with each other. Raw citations are normalized
    by using field-categorization schemes to achieve comparable citation scores.
    There are different approaches to field categorization available. They can
    be broadly classified as intellectual and algorithmic approaches. A
    paper-based algorithmically constructed classification system (ACCS) was
    proposed which is based on citation relations. Using a few ACCS
    field-specific clusters, we investigate the discriminatory power of the
    ACCS. The micro study focusses on the topic ‘overall water splitting’ and
    related topics. The first part of the study investigates intellectually
    whether the ACCS is able to identify papers on overall water splitting
    reliably and validly. Next, we compare the ACCS with (1) a paper-based
    intellectual (INSPEC) classification and (2) a journal-based intellectual
    classification (Web of Science, WoS, subject categories). In the last part
    of our case study, we compare the average number of citations in selected
    ACCS clusters (on overall water splitting and related topics) with the
    average citation count of publications in WoS subject categories related to
    these clusters. The results of this micro study question the discriminatory
    power of the ACCS. We recommend larger follow-up studies on broad datasets.

    In probability and statistics, the Hellinger distance (closely related to,
    although different from, the Bhattacharyya distance) is used to quantify the
    similarity between two probability distributions. It is a type of
    f-divergence.  The Hellinger distance is defined in terms of the Hellinger
    integral, which was introduced by Ernst Hellinger in 1909.

  abstract: >-
    Novel scientiﬁc knowledge is constantly produced by the scientiﬁc community.
    Understanding the level of novelty characterized by scientiﬁc literature is
    key for modeling scientiﬁc dynamics and analyzing the growth mechanisms of
    scientiﬁc knowledge. Metrics derived from bibliometrics and citation
    analysis were effectively used to characterize the novelty in scientiﬁc
    development. However, time is required before we can observe links between
    documents such as citation links or patterns derived from the links, which
    makes these techniques more effective for retrospective analysis than
    predictive analysis. In this study, we present a new approach to measuring
    the novelty of a research topic in a scientiﬁc community over a speciﬁc
    period by tracking semantic changes of the terms and characterizing the
    research topic in their usage context. The semantic changes are derived from
    the text data of scientiﬁc literature by temporal embedding learning
    techniques. We validated the effects of the proposed novelty metric on
    predicting the future growth of scientiﬁc publications and investigated the
    relations between novelty and growth by panel data analysis applied in a
    large-scale publication dataset (MEDLINE/PubMed). Key ﬁndings based on the
    statistical investigation indicate that the novelty metric has signiﬁcant
    predictive effects on the growth of scientiﬁc literature and the predictive
    effects may last for more than ten years. We demonstrated the effectiveness
    and practical implications of the novelty metric in three case studies.

    Berkeley Electronic Press Selected Works, Creative use of bibliometric
    analysis in evaluation offers an unparalleled opportunity to take advantage
    of the rich information embedded in the written products of scientific work
    to track the output and influence of funded scholars. Many metrics and
    techniques have been developed: from publication and citation counts to
    percentile rankings, h-index, impact factor, maps of the knowledge
    landscape, maps of geographical distribution, and metrics of
    interdisciplinarity and specialization. Analysis can demonstrate evolution
    over long periods of time, and can draw quantitative comparisons among
    subgroups or with others anywhere in the world. It would be dangerous to
    consider such data and analysis as “easy” however. Careful attention to
    detail and method are required to produce robust results.

  abstract: >-
    There is widespread interest in evaluating the social impacts of research
    and other scholarly activities. Conventional metrics for social impacts
    focus on economics or wealth creation, such as patents or technology
    transfer. These kinds of metrics are less appropriate for many scholarly
    fields, and miss the specific social concerns or needs that researchers aim
    to address. In this paper, drawing on ideas from ethics and development
    economics, we develop a conceptual framework for characterizing the social
    goals of research. We first distinguish resources — such as wealth and
    intellectual credit — from the goals of scholarship, and further distinguish
    inward- and outward-facing goals. Outward-facing goals refer to the intended
    social impacts of research. Next we introduce the Capabilities Approach, a
    conceptual framework for human well-being developed by ethicists and
    economists over the last 40 years. This Approach focuses on basic human
    needs, rather than wealth, and we draw specifically on a list of central
    human capabilities developed by philosopher Martha Nussbaum. We propose that
    the items on this list provide a useful starting point for articulating the
    specific social aims of research. We argue that the Capabilities Approach
    can facilitate research communication and improve the recognition of public
    engagement in academic and funding institutions. Familiar bibliographic data
    and text mining methods can be used in a capabilities-inspired portfolio
    analysis, and modest changes to existing data collection systems — for
    tenure and promotion, or research funding applications — could support the
    development of even richer capabilities-inspired metrics and incentive
    systems.

    The U.S. National Science Foundation (NSF), together with other federal
    agencies, launched the National Robotics Initiative (NRI) program in 2011.
    The aim of the NRI is to accelerate the development and use of collaborative
    robots (corobots), which work beside or cooperatively with people. To date,
    the NRI program has involved multiple directorates of the NSF (Computer and
    Information Science and Engineering; Engineering; Social, Behavioral, and
    Economic Sciences; and Education and Human Resources) and several other
    federal research funding agencies [the U.S. Department of Agriculture
    (USDA), the National Institutes of Health (NIH), the U.S. Department of
    Energy (DOE), NASA, and the U.S. Department of Defense (DOD)]. As the
    program prepared to announce its sixth round of awards in the summer of
    2017, we took the opportunity to reflect on the impacts of the first five
    years of NRI funding.

    In 2004, the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation launched a new program focused on
    incubating a new field, “Microbiology of the Built Environment” (MoBE). By
    the end of 2017, the program had supported the publication of hundreds of
    scholarly works, but it was unclear to what extent it had stimulated the
    development of a new research community. We identified 307 works funded by
    the MoBE program, as well as a comparison set of 698 authors who published
    in the same journals during the same period of time but were not part of the
    Sloan Foundation-funded collaboration. Our analysis of collaboration
    networks for both groups of authors suggests that the Sloan Foundation’s
    program resulted in a more consolidated community of researchers,
    specifically in terms of number of components, diameter, density, and
    transitivity of the coauthor networks. In addition to highlighting the
    success of this particular program, our method could be applied to other
    fields to examine the impact of funding programs and other large-scale
    initiatives on the formation of research communities.

  abstract: >-
    Prior work finds a diversity paradox: Diversity breeds innovation, yet
    underrepresented groups that diversify organizations have less successful
    careers within them. Does the diversity paradox hold for scientists as well?
    We study this by utilizing a near-complete population of ∼1.2 million US
    doctoral recipients from 1977 to 2015 and following their careers into
    publishing and faculty positions. We use text analysis and machine learning
    to answer a series of questions: How do we detect scientific innovations?
    Are underrepresented groups more likely to generate scientific innovations?
    And are the innovations of underrepresented groups adopted and rewarded? Our
    analyses show that underrepresented groups produce higher rates of
    scientific novelty. However, their novel contributions are devalued and
    discounted: For example, novel contributions by gender and racial minorities
    are taken up by other scholars at lower rates than novel contributions by
    gender and racial majorities, and equally impactful contributions of gender
    and racial minorities are less likely to result in successful scientific
    careers than for majority groups. These results suggest there may be
    unwarranted reproduction of stratification in academic careers that
    discounts diversity’s role in innovation and partly explains the
    underrepresentation of some groups in academia.

    In this paper I attempt to answer the question: What is interdisciplinary
    communication? I attempt to answer this question, rather than what some
    might consider the ontologically prior question—what is interdisciplinarity
    (ID)?—for two reasons: (1) there is no generally agreed-upon definition of
    ID; and (2) one’s views regarding interdisciplinary communication have a
    normative relationship with one’s other views of ID, including one’s views
    of its very essence. I support these claims with reference to the growing
    literature on ID, which has a marked tendency to favor the idea that
    interdisciplinary communication entails some kind of ‘integration’. The
    literature on ID does not yet include very many philosophers, but we have
    something valuable to offer in addressing the question of interdisciplinary
    communication. Playing somewhat fast-and-loose with traditional categories
    of the subdisciplines of philosophy, I group some philosophers—mostly from
    the philosophy of science, social–political philosophy, and moral theory—and
    some non-philosophers together to provide three different, but related,
    answers to the question of interdisciplinary communication. The groups are
    as follows: (1) Habermas–Klein, (2) Kuhn–MacIntyre, and (3)
    Bataille–Lyotard. These groups can also be thought of in terms of the types
    of answers they give to the question of interdisciplinary communication,
    especially in terms of the following key words (where the numbers correspond
    to the groups from the previous sentence): (1) consensus, (2)
    incommensurability, and (3) invention.

    This multi-layered case study examines the evolution and operations of one
    long-lived organized research unit (ORU), the Office of Arid Lands Studies
    (OALS), at the University of Arizona (UA). The first part includes a history
    of arid lands research at the UA and the beginning of OALS, a review of the
    Office's extramural and internal funding since 1964, and a comparison of
    that data and other performance indicators with other ORUs and, to some
    extent, with departments. The results are examined in relation to U.S.
    science policy and the theory of academic capitalism. The second part
    explores the causes of OALS' 1981 administrative move from the Vice
    President for Research Office to the College of Agriculture in the context
    of the University's multiple cultures and institutional and resource
    dependence theories of organizational change. The final part considers the
    influence of student workers on faculty supervisors who work as technicians
    in an OALS lab, and the role of funding agencies in the lab's operations.
    Theories of power and technology in the workplace provide a frame for the
    discussion. Findings suggest the placement of this ORU in a college has been
    beneficial in clarifying research turf, minimizing conflicts, supporting
    instruction, and in terms of funding. OALS' extramural support has averaged
    more than four dollars to every one dollar received internally, and OALS
    faculty compare favorably with other faculty in numbers of publications, and
    to a certain extent with teaching and advising. While the OALS remote
    sensing lab does utilize students as sources of cheap labor, the students do
    have considerable influence over how the lab operates. The only areas of
    conflict occurred over linking thesis topics to research projects and in
    meeting funding agency deadlines.

    Both funding agencies and scholars in science studies have become
    increasingly concerned with how to define and identify interdisciplinarity
    in research. The task is tricky, since the complexity of interdisciplinary
    research defies a single definition. Our study tackles this challenge by
    demonstrating a new typology and qualitative indicators for analyzing
    interdisciplinarity in research documents. The proposed conceptual framework
    attempts to fulfill the need for a robust and nuanced approach that is
    grounded in deeper knowledge of interdisciplinarity. As an example of using
    the framework, we discuss our empirical investigation of research proposals
    funded by a national funding agency in Finland.

    Stakeholders in the science system need to decide where to place their bets.
    Example questions include: Which areas of research should get more funding?
    Who should we hire? Which projects should we abandon and which new projects
    should we start? Making informed choices requires knowledge about these
    research options. Unfortunately, to date research portfolio options have not
    been defined in a consistent, transparent and relevant manner. Furthermore,
    we don’t know how to define demand for these options. In this article, we
    address the issues of consistency, transparency, relevance and demand by
    using a model of science consisting of 91,726 topics (or research options)
    that contain over 58 million documents. We present a new indicator of topic
    prominence – a measure of visibility, momentum and, ultimately, demand. We
    assign over $203 billion of project-level funding data from STAR METRICS® to
    individual topics in science, and show that the indicator of topic
    prominence, explains over one-third of the variance in current (or future)
    funding by topic. We also show that highly prominent topics receive far more
    funding per researcher than topics that are not prominent. Implications of
    these results for research planning and portfolio analysis by institutions
    and researchers are emphasized.

  abstract: "Aim/Purpose: Collaborative, interdisciplinary research is growing rapidly, but we still have limited and fragmented understanding of what is arguably the heart of such research—collaborative, interdisciplinary reasoning (CIR). \n\nBackground: This article integrates neo-Pragmatist theories of reasoning with insights from literature on interdisciplinary research to develop a working definition of collaborative, interdisciplinary reasoning. The article then applies this definition to an empirical example to demonstrate its utility.\n\nMethodology: The empirical example is an excerpt from a Toolbox workshop transcript. The article reconstructs a cogent, inductive, interdisciplinary argument from the excerpt to show how CIR can proceed in an actual team.\n\nContribution: The study contributes operational definitions of ‘reasoning together’ and ‘collaborative, interdisciplinary reasoning’ to existing literature. It also demonstrates empirical methods for operationalizing these definitions, with the argument reconstruction providing a brief case study in how teams reason together.\n\nFindings: 1.\tCollaborative, interdisciplinary reasoning is the attempted integration of disciplinary contributions to exchange, evaluate, and assert claims that enable shared understanding and eventually action in a local context.\n2.\tPragma-dialectic argument reconstruction with conversation analysis is a method for observing such reasoning from a transcript.\n3.\tThe example team developed a strong inductive argument to integrate their disciplinary contributions about modeling.\n\nRecommendations for Practitioners: 1.\tInterdisciplinary work requires agreeing with teammates about what is assertible and why.\n2.\tTo assert something together legitimately requires making a cogent, integrated argument.\n\nRecommendation for Researchers: 1.\tAn argument is the basic unit of analysis for interdisciplinary integration.\n2.\tTo assess the argument’s cogency, it is helpful to reconstruct it using pragma-dialectic principles and conversation analysis tools. \n3.\tTo assess the argument’s interdisciplinary integration and participant roles in the integration, it is helpful to graph the flow of words as a Sankey chart from participant-disciplines to the argument conclusion.\n\n\nFuture Research: How does this definition of CIR relate to other interdisciplinary ‘cognition’ or ‘learning’ type theories? How can practitioners and theorists tell the difference between true intersubjectivity and superficial agreeableness in these dialogues? What makes an instance of CIR ‘good’ or ‘bad’? How does collaborative, transdisciplinary reasoning differ from CIR, if at all?"

    Scholars belong to multiple communities of credit simultaneously. When these
    communities disagree about a scholarly achievement’s credit assignment, this
    raises a puzzle for decision and game theoretic models of credit seeking in
    science. The reference class problem for credit valuation in science is the
    problem of determining to which of an agent’s communities—which reference
    class—credit determinations should be indexed for an act under some state of
    nature. Solving this problem requires developing rich, mutually informed
    theories of community and credit that are sensitive to the structure and
    status systems of complex, heterogeneous scholarly networks.

  abstract: >-
    Questions of definition and measurement continue to constrain a consensus on
    the measurement of interdisciplinarity. Using Rao-Stirling (RS) Diversity
    sometimes produces anomalous results. We argue that these unexpected
    outcomes can be related to the use of “dual-concept diversity” which
    combines “variety” and “balance” in the definitions (ex ante). We propose to
    modify RS Diversity into a new indicator (DIV) which operationalizes
    “variety,” “balance,” and “disparity” independently and then combines them
    ex post. “Balance” can be measured using the Gini coefficient. We apply DIV
    to the aggregated citation patterns of 11,487 journals covered by the
    Journal Citation Reports 2016 of the Science Citation Index and the Social
    Sciences Citation Index as an empirical domain and, in more detail, to the
    citation patterns of 85 journals assigned to the Web-of-Science category
    “information science & library science” in both the cited and citing
    directions. We compare the results of the indicators and show that DIV
    provides improved results in terms of distinguishing between
    interdisciplinary knowledge integration (citing references) versus knowledge
    diffusion (cited impact). The new diversity indicator and RS diversity
    measure different features. A routine for the measurement of the various
    operationalization of diversity (in any data matrix) is made available
    online.

    Previous studies in the sociology of science have relied on measures of
    production and citations which have failed to take account of multiple
    authorship. This study indicates that these previous (and still currently
    used) measures introduce intolerable error and often profoundly influence
    substantive interpretation. To address the problem of multiple authorship in
    the measurement of publications and citations, a revision of current indices
    is presented. Previous measurement error may well require a re-analysis and
    rethinking of previous reported studies in the sociology of science.

  abstract: >-
    In Studying Human Behavior, Helen E. Longino enters into the complexities of
    human behavioral research, a domain still dominated by the age-old debate of
    “nature versus nurture.” Rather than supporting one side or another or
    attempting to replace that dichotomy with a different framework for
    understanding behavior, Longino focuses on how scientists study it,
    specifically sexual behavior and aggression, and asks what can be known
    about human behavior through empirical investigation. She dissects five
    approaches to the study of behavior—quantitative behavioral genetics,
    molecular behavior genetics, developmental psychology, neurophysiology and
    anatomy, and social/environmental methods—highlighting the underlying
    assumptions of these disciplines, as well as the different questions and
    mechanisms each addresses. She also analyzes efforts to integrate different
    approaches. Longino concludes that there is no single “correct” approach but
    that each contributes to our overall understanding of human behavior. In
    addition, Longino reflects on the reception and transmission of this
    behavioral research in scientific, social, clinical, and political spheres.
    A highly significant and innovative study that bears on crucial scientific
    questions, Studying Human Behavior will be essential reading not only for
    scientists and philosophers but also for science journalists and anyone
    interested in the engrossing challenges of understanding human behavior.

    Relationships between authors based on characteristics of published
    literature have been studied for decades. Author cocitation analysis using
    mapping techniques has been most frequently used to study how closely two
    authors are thought to be in intellectual space based on how members of the
    research community co-cite their works. Other approaches exist to study
    author relatedness based more directly on the text of their published works.
    In this study we present static and dynamic word-based approaches using
    vector space modeling, as well as a topic-based approach based on latent
    Dirichlet allocation for mapping author research relatedness. Vector space
    modeling is used to define an author space consisting of works by a given
    author. Outcomes for the two word-based approaches and a topic-based
    approach for 50 prolific authors in library and information science are
    compared with more traditional author cocitation analysis using
    multidimensional scaling and hierarchical cluster analysis. The two
    word-based approaches produced similar outcomes except where two authors
    were frequent co-authors for the majority of their articles. The topic-based
    approach produced the most distinctive map.

    As a discipline of its own, the philosophy of science can be traced back to
    the founding of its academic journals, some of which go back to the first
    half of the twentieth century. While the discipline has been the object of
    many historical studies, notably focusing on specific schools (e.g., logical
    empiricism) or major figures of the field (e.g., Carnap, Kuhn), little work
    has focused on the journals themselves. Here, we investigate contemporary
    philosophy of science by means of computational text-mining approaches: we
    apply topic-modeling algorithms to eight major philosophy of science
    journals, from the 1930s up until 2017. Based on the full-text content of
    some 15,897 articles, we identified 25 research themes and 8 thematic
    clusters that show how the research agenda of the philosophy of science has
    changed in its content over the course of the last eight decades, up to the
    philosophy of science we now know. We also show how each one of the journals
    contributed in its own way to this thematic evolution.

    The paper gives a new optimal property of the classical method of
    multi-dimensional scaling when the distance matrix is non-Euclidean. We also
    examine robustness of the method under a linear model. A technique to
    estimate missing values is also given.

    Statistical Rethinking: A Bayesian Course with Examples in R and Stan builds
    readers’ knowledge of and confidence in statistical modeling. Reflecting the
    need for even minor programming in today’s model-based statistics, the book
    pushes readers to perform step-by-step calculations that are usually
    automated. This unique computational approach ensures that readers
    understand enough of the details to make reasonable choices and
    interpretations in their own modeling work.  The text presents generalized
    linear multilevel models from a Bayesian perspective, relying on a simple
    logical interpretation of Bayesian probability and maximum entropy. It
    covers from the basics of regression to multilevel models. The author also
    discusses measurement error, missing data, and Gaussian process models for
    spatial and network autocorrelation.  By using complete R code examples
    throughout, this book provides a practical foundation for performing
    statistical inference. Designed for both PhD students and seasoned
    professionals in the natural and social sciences, it prepares them for more
    advanced or specialized statistical modeling.  Web ResourceThe book is
    accompanied by an R package (rethinking) that is available on the author’s
    website and GitHub. The two core functions (map and map2stan) of this
    package allow a variety of statistical models to be constructed from
    standard model formulas.

  abstract: >-
    This account of the Matthew effect is another small exercise in the
    psychosociological analysis of the workings of science as a social
    institution. The initial problem is transformed by a shift in theoretical
    perspective. As originally identified, the Matthew effect was construed in
    terms of enhancement of the position of already eminent scientists who are
    given disproportionate credit in cases of collaboration or of independent
    multiple discoveries. Its significance was thus confined to its implications
    for the reward system of science. By shifting the angle of vision, we note
    other possible kinds of consequences, this time for the communication system
    of science. The Matthew effect may serve to heighten the visibility of
    contributions to science by scientists of acknowledged standing and to
    reduce the visibility of contributions by authors who are less well known.
    We examine the psychosocial conditions and mechanisms underlying this effect
    and find a correlation between the redundancy function of multiple
    discoveries and the focalizing function of eminent men of science—a function
    which is reinforced by the great value these men place upon finding basic
    problems and by their self-assurance. This self-assurance, which is partly
    inherent, partly the result of experiences and associations in creative
    scientific environments, and partly a result of later social validation of
    their position, encourages them to search out risky but important problems
    and to highlight the results of their inquiry. A macrosocial version of the
    Matthew principle is apparently involved in those processes of social
    selection that currently lead to the concentration of scientific resources
    and talent (50).

  abstract: >-
    The spread of ideas in the scientific community is often viewed as a
    competition, in which good ideas spread further because of greater intrinsic
    fitness, and publication venue and citation counts correlate with importance
    and impact. However, relatively little is known about how structural factors
    influence the spread of ideas, and specifically how where an idea originates
    might influence how it spreads. Here, we investigate the role of faculty
    hiring networks, which embody the set of researcher transitions from
    doctoral to faculty institutions, in shaping the spread of ideas in computer
    science, and the importance of where in the network an idea originates. We
    consider comprehensive data on the hiring events of 5032 faculty at all 205
    Ph.D.-granting departments of computer science in the U.S. and Canada, and
    on the timing and titles of 200,476 associated publications. Analyzing five
    popular research topics, we show empirically that faculty hiring can and
    does facilitate the spread of ideas in science. Having established such a
    mechanism, we then analyze its potential consequences using epidemic models
    to simulate the generic spread of research ideas and quantify the impact of
    where an idea originates on its longterm diffusion across the network. We
    find that research from prestigious institutions spreads more quickly and
    completely than work of similar quality originating from less prestigious
    institutions. Our analyses establish the theoretical trade-offs between
    university prestige and the quality of ideas necessary for efficient
    circulation. Our results establish faculty hiring as an underlying mechanism
    that drives the persistent epistemic advantage observed for elite
    institutions, and provide a theoretical lower bound for the impact of
    structural inequality in shaping the spread of ideas in science.

    As the National Science Foundation (NSF) implements new cross-cutting
    initiatives and programs, interest in assessing the success of these
    experiments in fostering interdisciplinarity grows. A primary challenge in
    measuring interdisciplinarity is identifying and bounding the discrete
    disciplines that comprise interdisciplinary work. Using statistical
    text-mining techniques to extract topic bins, the NSF recently developed a
    topic map of all of their awards issued between 2000 and 2011. These new
    data provide a novel means for measuring interdisciplinarity by assessing
    the language or content of award proposals. Using the Directorate for
    Social, Behavioral, and Economic Sciences as a case study and drawing on the
    new topic model of the NSF’s awards, this paper explores new methods for
    quantifying interdisciplinarity in the NSF portfolio.

    In this paper, we analyse the effects of different types of formal
    collaboration and research topics on research impact of academic articles in
    the area of agricultural, resource, environmental, and ecological economics.
    The research impact is measured by the number of times an article has been
    cited each year since publication. The topics within the area of research
    are modelled using latent semantic analysis. We distinguish between the
    effect of institutional, national, and international collaboration. We use
    statistical models for count data and control for the impacts of journals,
    publication year, and years since publication. We find that, holding other
    factors constant, collaboration in the form of co-authorship increases
    research impact. The effect of inter-institutional collaboration within same
    country is similar to the effect of collaboration within same institution.
    However, international collaboration results in additional increase in
    impact. We find that the topic of a paper substantially influences number of
    citations and identified which topics are associated with greater impact.
    The effects of different types of collaboration on citations also vary
    across topics.

  abstract: >-
    This paper analyzes the effect of university research centers on the
    productivity and collaboration patterns of university faculty. University
    research centers are an important subject for policy analysis insofar that
    they have become the predominant policy response to scientific and technical
    demands that have not been met by extant institutions, including academic
    departments, private firms, and government laboratories. Specifically, these
    centers aim to organize researchers from across the disciplines and sectors
    which, collectively as a research unit, possess the scientific and technical
    capacity relevant to scientific and technical goals of the sponsoring
    agencies. In this paper, we measure the productivity and collaboration
    patterns of university researchers affiliated with a relatively large-scale
    and “mature” university research center to discern the effects, if any, of
    the center mechanism on individual scientists and engineers. Based on an
    analysis of longitudinal bibliometric data, the results from this case study
    demonstrate affiliation with the center to be effective at enhancing overall
    productivity as well as at facilitating cross-discipline, cross-sector, and
    inter-institutional productivity and collaborations.

    We offer two metrics that together help gauge how interdisciplinary a body
    of research is. Both draw upon Web of Knowledge Subject Categories (SCs) as
    key units of analysis. We have assembled two substantial Web of Knowledge
    samples from which to determine how closely individual SCs relate to each
    other. “Integration” measures the extent to which a research article cites
    diverse SCs. “Specialization” considers the spread of SCs in which the body
    of research (e.g., the work of a given author in a specified time period) is
    published. Pilot results for a sample of researchers show a surprising
    degree of interdisciplinarity.

  abstract: >-
    In the last two decades there have been studies claiming that science is
    becoming ever more interdisciplinary. However, the evidence has been
    anecdotal or partial. Here we investigate how the degree of
    interdisciplinarity has changed between 1975 and 2005 over six research
    domains. To do so, we compute well-established bibliometric indicators
    alongside a new index of interdisciplinarity (Integration score, aka
    Rao-Stirling diversity) and a science mapping visualization method. The
    results attest to notable changes in research practices over this 30 year
    period, namely major increases in number of cited disciplines and references
    per article (both show about 50% growth), and co-authors per article (about
    75% growth). However, the new index of interdisciplinarity only shows a
    modest increase (mostly around 5% growth). Science maps hint that this is
    because the distribution of citations of an article remains mainly within
    neighboring disciplinary areas. These findings suggest that science is
    indeed becoming more interdisciplinary, but in small steps — drawing mainly
    from neighboring fields and only modestly increasing the connections to
    distant cognitive areas. The combination of metrics and overlay science maps
    provides general benchmarks for future studies of interdisciplinary research
    characteristics.

  abstract: >-
    Science is the study of our world, as it is in its messy reality.
    Nonetheless, science requires idealization to function—if we are to attempt
    to understand the world, we have to find ways to reduce its complexity. 
    Idealization and the Aims of Science shows just how crucial idealization is
    to science and why it matters. Beginning with the acknowledgment of our
    status as limited human agents trying to make sense of an exceedingly
    complex world, Angela Potochnik moves on to explain how science aims to
    depict and make use of causal patterns—a project that makes essential use of
    idealization. She offers case studies from a number of branches of science
    to demonstrate the ubiquity of idealization, shows how causal patterns are
    used to develop scientific explanations, and describes how the necessarily
    imperfect connection between science and truth leads to researchers’ values
    influencing their findings. The resulting book is a tour de force, a
    synthesis of the study of idealization that also offers countless new
    insights and avenues for future exploration.

    The multidimensional character and inherent conflict with categorisation of
    interdisciplinarity makes its mapping and evaluation a challenging task. We
    propose a conceptual framework that aims to capture interdisciplinarity in
    the wider sense of knowledge integration, by exploring the concepts of
    diversity and coherence. Disciplinary diversity indicators are developed to
    describe the heterogeneity of a bibliometric set viewed from predefined
    categories, i.e. using a top-down approach that locates the set on the
    global map of science. Network coherence indicators are constructed to
    measure the intensity of similarity relations within a bibliometric set,
    i.e. using a bottom-up approach, which reveals the structural consistency of
    the publications network. We carry out case studies on individual articles
    in bionanoscience to illustrate how these two perspectives identify
    different aspects of interdisciplinarity: disciplinary diversity indicates
    the large-scale breadth of the knowledge base of a publication; network
    coherence reflects the novelty of its knowledge integration. We suggest that
    the combination of these two approaches may be useful for comparative
    studies of emergent scientific and technological fields, where new and
    controversial categorisations are accompanied by equally contested claims of
    novelty and interdisciplinarity.

  abstract: >-
    The detection of differences or similarities in large numbers of scientific
    publications is an open problem in scientometric research. In this paper we
    therefore develop and apply a machine learning approach based on structural
    topic modelling in combination with cosine similarity and a linear
    regression framework in order to identify differences in dissertation titles
    written at East and West German universities before and after German
    reunification. German reunification and its surrounding time period is used
    because it provides a structure with both minor and major differences in
    research topics that could be detected by our approach. Our dataset is based
    on dissertation titles in economics and business administration and
    chemistry from 1980 to 2010. We use university affiliation and year of the
    dissertation to train a structural topic model and then test the model on a
    set of unseen dissertation titles. Subsequently, we compare the resulting
    topic distribution of each title to every other title with cosine
    similarity. The cosine similarities and the regional and temporal origin of
    the dissertation titles they come from are then used in a linear regression
    approach. Our results on research topics in economics and business
    administration suggest substantial differences between East and West Germany
    before the reunification and a rapid conformation thereafter. In chemistry
    we observe minor differences between East and West before the reunification
    and a slightly increased similarity thereafter.

    The Structural Topic Model allows researchers to ﬂexibly estimate a topic
    model that includes document-level metadata. Estimation is accomplished
    through a fast variational approximation. The stm package provides many
    useful features, including rich ways to explore topics, estimate
    uncertainty, and visualize quantities of interest.

    In the context of increasing support for interdisciplinary modes of
    research, many in the policy, scientific, and academic communities propose
    that universities should change structurally to reduce the barriers to
    investigation that involves researchers from multiple disciplines. This
    paper examines ‘interdisciplinary strategies’ in U.S. research
    universities—deliberate efforts to spur collaborative research across
    traditional departmental and disciplinary boundaries, including the creation
    and adaptation of university policies, practices, and structures. It
    identifies and analyzes the use of incentive grants to initiate new
    interdisciplinary units, the establishment of ‘campus-wide institutes’ that
    steer campus investments in interdisciplinary areas, and new modes of
    faculty hiring and evaluation. Illustrative examples are provided, and the
    implications of these strategies are discussed.

    Organized research units—also known as centers, institutes, and
    laboratories—are increasingly prominent in the university. This paper
    examines how ORUs emerge to promote global agendas and international
    collaborations in an academic health center in North America. The roles
    these units play in helping researchers work across institutional and
    national boundaries are identified and analyzed. The concept of boundary
    organizations is employed to explain the features of ORUs and the challenges
    they face. Findings provide insight into how such units operate between
    local and global mandates, interest groups, and sources of influence,
    helping to extend university research into the global space.

    Faculty at research universities face the challenge of doing research that
    both interests consumer agencies and possesses academic credibility. The
    Center for Consumer Research at the University of California, Davis, evolved
    an approach for doing this based on ecological methodology, an action
    research model, multi-channel dissemination, and post-research evaluation.
    The lessons learned during the 16-year history of this nondepartmental
    center should be of interest to consumer researchers.

    Scientific work is heterogeneous, requiring many different actors and
    viewpoints. It also requires cooperation. The two create tension between
    divergent viewpoints and the need for generalizable findings. We present a
    model of how one group of actors managed this tension. It draws on the work
    of amateurs, professionals, administrators and others connected to the
    Museum of Vertebrate Zoology at the University of California, Berkeley,
    during its early years. Extending the Latour-Callon model of interessement,
    two major activities are central for translating between viewpoints:
    standardization of methods, and the development of `boundary objects'.
    Boundary objects are both adaptable to different viewpoints and robust
    enough to maintain identity across them. We distinguish four types of
    boundary objects: repositories, ideal types, coincident boundaries and
    standardized forms.

    We examined the publication records of a cohort of 168 life scientists in
    the field of ecology and evolutionary biology to assess gender differences
    in research performance. Clear discrepancies in publication rate between men
    and women appear very early in their careers and this has consequences for
    the subsequent citation of their work. We show that a recently proposed
    index designed to rank scientists fairly is in fact strongly biased against
    female researchers, and advocate a modified index to assess men and women on
    a more equitable basis.

    This article describes posterior maximization for topic models, identifying
    computational and conceptual gains from inference under a non-standard
    parametrization. We then show that ﬁtted parameters can be used as the basis
    for a novel approach to marginal likelihood estimation, via block-diagonal
    approximation to the information matrix, that facilitates choosing the
    number of latent topics. This likelihood-based model selection is
    complemented with a goodness-of-ﬁt analysis built around estimated residual
    dispersion. Examples are provided to illustrate model selection as well as
    to compare our estimation against standard alternative techniques.

    This study aims to undertake a bibliometric investigation of the NASA
    Astrobiology Institute (NAI) funded research that was published between 2008
    and 2012 (by teams of Cooperative Agreement Notice Four and Five). For this
    purpose, the study creates an inventory of publications co-authored through
    NAI funding and investigates journal preferences, international and
    institutional collaboration, and citation behaviors of researchers to reach
    a better understanding of interdisciplinary and collaborative astrobiology
    research funded by the NAI. Using the NAI annual reports, 1210 peer-reviewed
    publications are analyzed. The following conclusions are drawn: (1) NAI
    researchers prefer publishing in high-impact multidisciplinary journals. (2)
    Astronomy and astrophysics are the most preferred categories to publish
    based on Web of Science subject categories. (3) NAI is indeed a virtual
    institution; researchers collaborate with other researchers outside their
    organization and in some cases outside the U.S. (4) There are prominent
    scholars in the NAI co-author network but none of them dominates
    astrobiology.

    Making an Impact

    How big a role do unconventional combinations of existing knowledge play in
    the impact of a scientific paper? To examine this question, Uzzi et al. (p.
    468) studied 17.9 million research articles across five decades of the Web
    of Science, the largest repository of scientific research. Scientific work
    typically appeared to draw on highly conventional, familiar mixtures of
    knowledge. The highest-impact papers were not the ones that had the greatest
    novelty, but had a combination of novelty and otherwise conventional
    combinations of prior work.

    Novelty is an essential feature of creative ideas, yet the building blocks
    of new ideas are often embodied in existing knowledge. From this
    perspective, balancing atypical knowledge with conventional knowledge may be
    critical to the link between innovativeness and impact. Our analysis of 17.9
    million papers spanning all scientific fields suggests that science follows
    a nearly universal pattern: The highest-impact science is primarily grounded
    in exceptionally conventional combinations of prior work yet simultaneously
    features an intrusion of unusual combinations. Papers of this type were
    twice as likely to be highly cited works. Novel combinations of prior work
    are rare, yet teams are 37.7% more likely than solo authors to insert novel
    combinations into familiar knowledge domains.

    Highly cited work is simultaneously conventional and unconventional.

    Highly cited work is simultaneously conventional and unconventional.

    There is substantial literature on research performance differences between
    male and female researchers, and its explanation. Using publication records
    of 852 social scientists, we show that performance differences indeed exist.
    However, our case study suggests that in the younger generation of
    researchers these have disappeared. If performance differences exist at all
    in our case, young female researchers outperform young male researchers. The
    trend in developed societies, that women increasingly outperform men in all
    levels of education, is also becoming effective in the science system.

  abstract: >-
    Classifying journals or publications into research areas is an essential
    element of many bibliometric analyses. Classification usually takes place at
    the level of journals, where the Web of Science subject categories are the
    most popular classification system. However, journal?level classification
    systems have two important limitations: They offer only a limited amount of
    detail, and they have difficulties with multidisciplinary journals. To avoid
    these limitations, we introduce a new methodology for constructing
    classification systems at the level of individual publications. In the
    proposed methodology, publications are clustered into research areas based
    on citation relations. The methodology is able to deal with very large
    numbers of publications. We present an application in which a classification
    system is produced that includes almost 10 million publications. Based on an
    extensive analysis of this classification system, we discuss the strengths
    and the limitations of the proposed methodology. Important strengths are the
    transparency and relative simplicity of the methodology and its fairly
    modest computing and memory requirements. The main limitation of the
    methodology is its exclusive reliance on direct citation relations between
    publications. The accuracy of the methodology can probably be increased by
    also taking into account other types of relations?for instance, based on
    bibliographic coupling.

  abstract: >-
    We introduce a new algorithm for modularity-based community detection in
    large networks. The algorithm, which we refer to as a smart local moving
    algorithm, takes advantage of a well-known local moving heuristic that is
    also used by other algorithms. Compared with these other algorithms, our
    proposed algorithm uses the local moving heuristic in a more sophisticated
    way. Based on an analysis of a diverse set of networks, we show that our
    smart local moving algorithm identifies community structures with higher
    modularity values than other algorithms for large-scale modularity
    optimization, among which the popular “Louvain algorithm”. The computational
    efficiency of our algorithm makes it possible to perform community detection
    in networks with tens of millions of nodes and hundreds of millions of
    edges. Our smart local moving algorithm also performs well in small and
    medium-sized networks. In short computing times, it identifies community
    structures with modularity values equally high as, or almost as high as, the
    highest values reported in the literature, and sometimes even higher than
    the highest values found in the literature.

  abstract: >-
    Research which explores unchartered waters has a high potential for major
    impact but also carries a higher uncertainty of having impact. Such
    explorative research is often described as taking a novel approach. This
    study examines the complex relationship between pursuing a novel approach
    and impact. Viewing scientific research as a combinatorial process, we
    measure novelty in science by examining whether a published paper makes
    first-time-ever combinations of referenced journals, taking into account the
    difficulty of making such combinations. We apply this newly developed
    measure of novelty to all Web of Science research articles published in 2001
    across all scientific disciplines. We find that highly novel papers, defined
    to be those that make more (distant) new combinations, deliver high gains to
    science: they are more likely to be a top 1% highly cited paper in the long
    run, to inspire follow-on highly cited research, and to be cited in a
    broader set of disciplines and in disciplines that are more distant from
    their “home” field. At the same time, novel research is also more risky,
    reflected by a higher variance in its citation performance. We also find
    strong evidence of delayed recognition of novel papers as novel papers are
    less likely to be top cited when using short time-windows. In addition, we
    find that novel research is significantly more highly cited in “foreign”
    fields but not in their “home” field. Finally, novel papers are published in
    journals with a lower Impact Factor, compared with non-novel papers, ceteris
    paribus. These findings suggest that science policy, in particular funding
    decisions which rely on bibliometric indicators based on short-term citation
    counts and Journal Impact Factors, may be biased against “high risk/high
    gain” novel research. The findings also caution against a mono-disciplinary
    approach in peer review to assess the true value of novel research.

    This study explores the similarity among six types of scholarly networks
    aggregated at the institution level, including bibliographic coupling
    networks, citation networks, cocitation networks, topical networks,
    coauthorship networks, and coword networks. Cosine distance is chosen to
    measure the similarities among the six networks. The authors found that
    topical networks and coauthorship networks have the lowest similarity;
    cocitation networks and citation networks have high similarity;
    bibliographic coupling networks and cocitation networks have high
    similarity; and coword networks and topical networks have high similarity.
    In addition, through multidimensional scaling, two dimensions can be
    identified among the six networks: Dimension 1 can be interpreted as
    citation-based versus noncitation-based, and Dimension 2 can be interpreted
    as social versus cognitive. The authors recommend the use of hybrid or
    heterogeneous networks to study research interaction and scholarly
    communications.

  abstract: >-
    Science is increasingly organized in large-scale science centers.
    Expectations are that center-based research should yield qualitatively
    different research than single-investigator-produced research, but
    demonstrating the particular effects of a center is challenging. The notion
    of ‘centerness’ is that science centers can yield findings that reflect
    conceptual collisions across disciplinary or geographic boundaries between a
    center’s scientific members. Collaborative research commonly is assessed
    using co-authorships of scientific publications. Co-authorship measures can
    be conveniently and unobtrusively operationalized, yet they can yield
    indicators (especially for a small center) showing little change in
    collaboration in a center-context, while richer findings of collaboration
    are evidenced in observing other aspects of center members’ behavior. This
    article puts forth the use of social network analysis and bibliographic
    coupling as measures of ‘centerness’ and presents their characteristics in
    the context of an National Science Foundation (NSF) science center.
    Bibliographic coupling is characterized as a measure of centerness over the
    time period of the establishment of an NSF-funded science center. We also
    examine changes in bibliographic coupling indicators alongside changes in
    co-authorship networks and a social network survey of center participants.
    Bibliographic coupling is shown to make a distinctive contribution to
    measurement of centerness, demonstrating increasing coupling from the
    pre-center and since-center periods. This increase in centerness as
    represented in bibliographic coupling does not dramatically change when
    self-citations are removed. Overall, results show this to be a useful and
    consistent measure of centerness and knowledge coalescence within the
    research center environment.

    The Science of Science and Innovation Policy (SciSIP) program at the
    National Science Foundation (NSF) supports research designed to advance the
    scientific basis of science and innovation policy. The program was
    established at NSF in 2005 in response to a call from Dr. John Marburger
    III, then science advisor to the U.S. President, for a “science” of science
    policy. As of January 2011, it has co-funded 162 awards that aim to develop,
    improve, and expand data, analytical tools, and models that can be directly
    applied in the science policy decision making process. The long-term goals
    of the SciSIP program are to provide a scientifically rigorous and
    quantitative basis for science policy and to establish an international
    community of practice. The program has an active listserv that, as of
    January 2011, has almost 700 members from academia, government, and
    industry. This study analyzed all SciSIP awards (through January 2011) to
    identify existing collaboration networks and co-funding relations between
    SciSIP and other areas of science. In addition, listserv data was downloaded
    and analyzed to derive complementary discourse information. Key results
    include evidence of rich diversity in communication and funding networks and
    effective strategies for interlinking researcher and science policy makers,
    prompting discussion, and resource sharing.
